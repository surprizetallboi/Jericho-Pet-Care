          Jericho Pet Care is my privately owned and insured pet sitting business founded in
          2020.
          <br/>
          I have been a professional pet sitter since 2018.
          <br />
          Iâ€™ve been a pet owner myself for many years, and I know how important
          it is to choose the right person to care for your pets. I am always
          willing and eager to meet more dogs and cats and provide loving,
          specialized care to each and every one!
